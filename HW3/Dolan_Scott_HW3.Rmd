> 2. In a certain community, 40% of the households sub-
scribe to a local newspaper, 30% subscribe to a newspaper
of national circulation, and 60% subscribe to at least one
of the two types of newspapers. Let E 1 denote the event
that a randomly chosen household subscribes to a local
newspaper, and let E 2 denote the corresponding event for
the national newspaper.

> (a) Make a Venn Diagram showing events E 1 and E 2 and
shade the region representing the 60% of the house-
holds that subscribe to at least one of the two types of
newspapers.

> 5. In testing the lifetime of components, the sample space
is the set S = {x:x > 0} of positive real numbers. Let A
be the event that the next component tested will last less
than 75 time units and B the event that it will last more
than 53 time units. In mathematical notation, A = {x:x <
75}, and B = {x:x > 53}. Describe each of the events

> (a) $A^c$ 

$A^c$ represents the compliment of A and is the set of all real numbers greater than or equal to 75

$$A^c\subset S = \{x:x \geq 75\}$$

> (b) A ∩ B

$A\cap B$ is the intersection of A and B and is the set of all real numbers greater than 53 and less than 75

$$A\cap B = \{x:53<x<75\}$$

> (c) A ∪ B

$A\cup B$ is the union of A and B and is the set of all real numbers greater than 0 and less than 75

$$A\cup B = \{x:0<x<75\}$$

> (d) (A − B)

$(A - B)$ is the set of all real numbers greater than zero and less than 53

$$(A - B)=\{x:0<x\leq53\}$$

> 9. In measuring the diameter of a cylinder to the
nearest millimeter the sample space (in cm) is S =
{5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7}. Five cylinders are randomly selected
and their diameters are measured to the nearest
millimeter.

```{r}
x = c(5.3,5.4,5.5,5.6,5.7)
S_x = data.frame(expand.grid(x1=x, x2=x, x3=x, x4=x, x5=x)) # lists all triplets in S1
```

> (a) Describe the sample space of this experiment. What is
the size of this sample space?

The sample space $S_x$ for this experiement is the set of quintuplets where $S_x = \{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5\}$ where $x_1$ = {5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7}, $x_2$ = {5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7},...$x_5$ = {5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7}. 
The size of the sample space $S_x$ is :
```{r}
cat(paste0(dim(S_x)[1],' possible outcomes.'))
```

> (b) Describe the sample space if only the average of the
five measurements is recorded, and use R commands
similar to those used in Example 2.2-3 to determine
the size of this sample space.

This sample space is the set of distinct averages where the averages are:
$\frac{x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5}{5}\newline$ and the size of this sample space is: 
```{r}
cat(paste0(length(table(rowSums(S_x)))), 'possible distinct outcomes.')
```

## Page 59 Problem 10

> 10. A random sample of 100 polycarbonate plastic disks
are categorized according to their hardness and shock
absorption. The results are shown in the table below.

![](/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/assignments/scott/P59P10table.png)

> A disk is selected at random. Define the events $E_1$ = {the
disk has low hardness}, $E_2$ = {the disk has low shock
absorption}, $E_3$ = {the disk has low shock absorption or
low hardness}.

> (a) How many of the 100 disks belong in each of the three
events?

$E_1$ has 5 + 16 = 21 disks. $E_2$ has 5 + 9 = 14 disks. $E_3$ has 21 + 14 - 5 disks

> (b) Make two drawings of a Venn diagram showing the
events $E_1$ and $E_2$ . On the first drawing shade the
event ($E_1\cap E_2$)$^c$ and on the second shade the event
$E_1^c \cup E_2^c$ . Confirm the second of De Morgan’s Laws
for these events.

![](/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/assignments/scott/P59P10b.png)

> (c) Describe in words the events $E_1\cap E_2 , E_1\cup E_2 , E_1 − E_2$ ,
and ($E_1 − E_2) \cup (E_2 − E_1$).

$E_1\cap E_2$ is the intersection of $E_1 & E_2$ which is the overlapping region of $E_1 & E_2$

$E_1\cup E_2$ is the union of $E_1 & E_2$ represents everthing that is in $E_1 or E_2$ which includes all of $E_1 and E_2$

$(E_1-E_2)\cup (E_2-E_1)$ is all of $E_1 & E_2$ minus the intersection of $E_1 & E_2$

(d) How many of the 100 disks belong in each of the
events in part (c)?

$E_1\cap E_2$ has 5 disks, $E_1\cup E_2$ has 30 disks, and $(E_1-E_2)\cup (E_2-E_1)$ has 25 disks

## Page 71 Problem 1

> 1. In electronics, a wafer is a thin slice of semiconductor
material used in the fabrication of integrated circuits and
other micro-devices. They are formed of highly pure crystalline material, which is doped (i.e., impurity atoms are
added) to modulate its electrical properties. The doping
is either n-type or p-type. Moreover, the doping is either
light or heavy (one dopant atom per 100 million atoms,
or per ten thousand atoms, respectively). The following
table shows a batch of 10 wafers broken down into the
four categories.

![](/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/assignments/scott/P73P1.png)

> One wafer is selected at random. Let $E_1$ denote the
event that the selected wafer is n-type, and $E_2$ the event
that the wafer is heavily doped. Find the probabilities
$P(E_1 ), P(E_2 ), P(E_1 ∩ E_2 ), P(E_1 ∪ E_2 ), P(E_1 − E_2 ), and
P((E_1 − E_2 ) ∪ (E_2 − E_1 ))$.

$P(E_1)$ = 2 + 3 = 5

$P(E_2)$ = 3 + 2 = 5 

$P(E_1 ∩ E_2 )$ = 3 

$P(E_1 ∪ E_2)$ = 5 + 5 -3 = 7

$P(E_1 − E_2)$ = 5 - 3 = 2

$P((E_1 − E_2 ) ∪ (E_2 − E_1 ))$ = 2 + 2 = 4

## Page 71 Problem 2

> 2. Refer to Exercise 1.![](/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/assignments/scott/P73P1.png)

> (a) Select two wafers, at random and with replacement,
from the batch of 10 wafers given in the exercise.

```{r}
set.seed(111)
x = c(rep('n-light',2),rep('n-heavy',3),rep('p-light',3),rep('p-heavy',2))
x
X = data.frame(expand.grid(x1=x, x2=x))
S_x = sample(x,2,replace=T)
S_x
```

> (i) Give the sample space for the experiment that
records the doping type of the two wafers and
the probability for each outcome.

The sample space for 2(a)(i) is: 
```{r}
x = c('Light','Heavy')
Sxa = expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x)
l = dim(Sxa)[1]
Sxa
```
P(light) = 0%, P(heavy) = 100%

> (ii) Give the sample space of the experiment that
records the number of n-type wafers among the
two selected and the corresponding probability
mass function.

The sample space for 2(a)(ii) is: 
```{r}
x = c('n-light','n-heavy')
Sxa2 = expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x)
Sxa2
pmf.s <- table(Sxa2)
pmf.s
```

> (b) Select four wafers, at random and with replacement,
from the batch of 10 wafers given in the exercise.

```{r}
Sxb = sample(x,4,replace=T)
Sxb
```

> (i) Give a verbal description of the sample space
for the experiment that records the dop-
ing type of the four wafers, find the size
of the sample space using the R commands
G=expand.grid(W1=0:1,W2=0:1,W3=0:1,W4=
0:1); length(G$W1), and give the probability
of each outcome.

sample space consists of 2 n and 2 p type, n = 0, p = 1

```{r}
G=expand.grid(W1=0:1,W2=0:1,W3=0:1,W4=0:1); length(G$W1)
```

n type has a probability of 1/8 and p type has a probability of 1/8

> (ii) Give the sample space of the experiment that
records the number of n-type wafers among
the four selected and the corresponding PMF
using the additional R commands attach(G);
table((W1+W2+W3+W4)/4)/length(W1).

```{r}
attach(G);
table((W1+W2+W3+W4)/4)/length(W1)
```

> (iii) Use the probability mass function to find the
probability of at most one n-type wafer among
the four selected.

I am pretty unsure about this problem and am going to have to say I don't know the answer and this is like a riddle to me at this point.

## Page 71 Problem 5

> 5. The R command S=expand.grid(X1=1:6, X2=1:6) gen-
erates the sample space of two die rolls. The additional R
command attach(S); Y=(X1==6)+(X2==6) generates the
number of times a six occurs for each of the 36 outcomes
in the sample space. Finally, the additional R commands
pr=table(Y)/36; pr generates the probability mass func-
tion for the experiment that records the number of times
a six occurs in two rolls of a die.

> (a) Use the PMF obtained and R commands similar to
those given in (2.3.7) to simulate 10 replications of
the experiment that records the number of times a six
occurs in two die rolls.

```{r}
set.seed(111)
S=expand.grid(X1=1:6, X2=1:6)
attach(S); Y=(X1==6)+(X2==6)
pr=table(Y)/36;
sample(2:12, size = 10, replace = T, prob = c(1:6, 5:1)/36)
```

> (b) Use the PMF obtained and R commands similar
to those given in (2.3.8), namely x= sample(0:2,
size=10000, replace=T, prob=pr); table(x)/10000, to
obtain the relative frequencies for each outcome in
the sample space of the experiment that records the
number of times a six occurs in two die rolls, based on
10,000 replications.

```{r}
x= sample(0:2,size=10000, replace=T, prob=pr); table(x)/10000
```

> (c) Use the R command hist(x,seq(-0.5, 2.5, 1), freq=F);
lines(0:2, pr, type=”p”, col=”red”); lines(0:2, pr,
type=”h”, col=”red”) to construct a histogram of
the relative frequencies and line graph of the probability mass function. This figure provides
empirical verification of which property?

```{r}
hist(x,seq(-0.5, 2.5, 1), freq=F)
lines(0:2, pr, type="p", col="red")
lines(0:2, pr, type="h", col="red")
```

This figure provides verification of the probability mass function.

## Page 72 Problem 9

> 9. Twelve individuals want to form a committee of
four.

> (a) How many committees are possible?

```{r}
x = 1:12
cat('There are ',dim(expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x,x3=x,x4=x))[1],' commitees possible')
```

> (b) The 12 individuals consist of 5 biologists, 4 chemists,
and 3 physicists. How many committees consisting of
2 biologists, 1 chemist, and 1 physicist are possible?

```{r}
# x = c(rep('bio',5),rep('chem',4),rep('phys',3))
# Sx = expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x,x3=x,x4=x)
# Y = c('bio','bio','chem','phys')
# Sy  = expand.grid(y1 = Y,y2 = Y, y3 = Y, y4 = Y)
# A = (Sx==Y)
# dim(A)[1]
cat(paste0('There are :',12^4/2^4,' committees possible'))
```

> (c) In the setting of part (b), if all committees are equally
likely, what is the probability the committee formed
will consist of 2 biologists, 1 chemist, and 1 physicist?

```{r}
cat(paste0('The probability is : ',(12^4/2^4)/12^4),'%')
```

## Page 72 Problem 11

> 11. A path going from the lower left corner of the grid in
Figure 2-7 to the upper right corner can be represented as
a binary sequence having four 0’s and four 1’s, with each 0
representing a move to the right and each 1 representing
a move upwards.

![](/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/assignments/scott/HW3P11.png)
> (a) How many paths going from the lower left corner to
the upper right corner of this grid are there?

```{r}

cat(paste0('There are ',factorial(8)/(factorial(4)^2),' routes possible'))
```
> (b) How many paths going from the lower left corner to
the upper right corner of this grid and passing through
the circled point are there?

```{r}
cat(paste0('There are ',factorial(5)/(factorial(3)*factorial(2)),' routes possible'))
```

> (c) If a path is selected at random, what is the probability
it will pass through the circled point?

```{r}
cat(paste0('The probability is:' ,(factorial(5)/(factorial(3)*factorial(2)))/(factorial(8)/(factorial(4)^2))))
```

## Page 72 Problem 14

> 14. A forest contains 30 moose of which six are captured,
tagged, and released. A certain time later, five of the 30
moose are captured.

> (a) How many samples of size five are possible?

```{r}
cat(paste0('There are ',factorial(30)/(factorial(30-5))),' samples possible')
```

> (b) How many samples of size five, which include two of
the six tagged moose, are possible?

```{r}
cat(paste0('There are ',(factorial(24)/factorial(24-3))*(factorial(6)/factorial(6-2))),' samples possible')
```

> (c) If the five captured moose represent a simple random
sample drawn from the 30 moose (six of which are
tagged), find the probability that 

> (i) two of the five captured moose are tagged and 

The probability that 2 of 5 moose captured are tagged is 364320/17100720 = 0.0213

> (ii) none of the five
captured moose is tagged.

The probability that 0 of 5 moose captured are tagged is 5100480/17100720 = 0.2983
