## Problem 1  

> An experiment is conducted to determine the optimal time and temperature
combination for baking a cake. The response variable of interest is taste.
Four batches of cake will be baked separately at each combination of baking
times (25 and 30 minutes) and temperature settings (275 $^oF$, 300 $^oF$, and 325 $^oF$).

```{r}
times = c(25,30)
temps = c(275,300,325)
combos = expand.grid(times,temps)
dat1 = data.frame(times,temps,'t'=combos[1:6,1],'T'=combos[1:6,2])
dat1
```

(a) What are the experimental units?  

The experimental units are the batches of cake

(b) What are the factors in this experiment?  

The factors in this experiment is time and temperature.  

(c) State the levels of each factor.  

The time has two levels, 25 and 30 minutes and the temperature has three levels, 275, 300 and 325 $^oF$.  

(d) List all the treatments in this experiment. 

1) time: 25 min, temp: 275 $^oF$

2) time: 25 min, temp: 300 $^oF$

3) time: 25 min, temp: 325 $^oF$

3) time: 30 min, temp: 325 $^oF$

(e) Is the response variable qualitative or quantitative?

The response variable is taste which is qualitative

## Problem 3 
> A quantification of coastal water quality converts measurements on several 
pollutants (arsenic in oyster shells, mercury, etc.) to a water quality index
with values from 1 to 10. An investigation into the after-clean-up waterquality
of a lake analyzes water samples collected from five areas encompassing the two
beaches on the eastern shore and the three beaches on the western shore. Let
$μ_1$ and $μ_2$ denote the mean water quality index for the beaches on the eastern
shore, and $μ_3$, $μ_4$, and $μ_5$ be the mean water quality index for the beaches
on the westernshore.

(a) Write the contrasts that represent the effects of each of the five areas.

The contrasts representing the effects of each of the five areas are: 

 > $\mu_1-\mu$
 
 > $\mu_2-\mu$
 
 > $\mu_3-\mu$
 
 > $\mu_4-\mu$
 
 > $\mu_5-\mu$

(b) Write the contrast for comparing the water quality around the two beaches
on the eastern shore with that around the three beaches on the western shore.


 > $\frac{\mu_1 + \mu_2}{2}\,-\frac{\mu_3+\mu_4+\mu_5}{3}$
 
## Problem 4

> An article reports on the results of a cloud-seeding experiment. 20 The 
question of interest is whether cloud seeding with silver nitrate increases 
rainfall. Out of 52 clouds, 26 were randomly selected for seeding, with the
remaining 26 serving as controls. The rainfall measurements, in acre-feet, 
are given in CloudSeedingData.txt. Use the R commands given in Example 1.8-4 
to construct a comparative boxplot and comment on possible differences in 
rainfall between seeded and unseeded clouds.

Set working directory and read data in

```{r}
#if(getwd()!='/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/akritas_datasets/'){
setwd('/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/akritas_datasets/')
dat4 = read.table('/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/akritas_datasets/CloudSeedingData.txt',header=T)
head(dat4)
w = stack(dat4) # stacks data and assigns indices
boxplot(w$values~w$ind, col = rainbow(4),ylab='Rainfall [acre-feet]',xlab='')
title('Comparing Rainfall for Unseeded and Seeded Clouds')
```

> Problem 4 Comments

As shown in the boxplot, the control group received less rain than the
seeded group did. The median of the control group is less than the median of
seeded group. The minimum of the seeded group is close to the minimum of the
control group however the maximum rainfall of the seeded group is over twice
the maximum of the control. Both groups have outliers with the control having 3
and the seeded having 4.

## Problem 5

> For its new generation of airplanes, a commercial airline is considering 
three new designs of the control panel as possible alternatives to the current
design with the aim of improving the pilot’s response time to emergency 
displays. Letting μ 1 denote the mean pilot response time to simulated 
emergency conditions with the current design, and μ 2 , μ 3 , and μ 4 denote 
the mean response times with the three new designs, write the control versus 
treatment contrasts.

The contrasts for the control vs. treatment are:

$\mu_1-\mu_2$

$\mu_1-\mu_3$
  
$\mu_1-\mu_4$

## Problem 11

> Import the data on monthly online and catalog sales of a company into the
R object oc using oc = read.table(”MonthlySalesOC.txt”, header = T).

```{r}
setwd('/home/scott/Documents/STAT401/akritas_datasets/')
dat11 = read.table('MonthlySalesOC.txt',header=T)
```

> (a) Use R commands similar to those in Example 1.8-5 to construct a bar graph 
comparing the online and catalog volumes of sale.

```{r}
m = rbind(dat11$Online, dat11$Catalog)
# creates a data matrix
barplot(m, names.arg = dat11$Month, col = c('darkblue', 'red'), 
        legend.text = c('Online','Catalog'), beside = T, las = 2,ylab='Volume of Sales [units]',xlab='Month')
title('Bar Graph Comparing the Online and Catalog Volumes of Sale')
```

> (b) Use R commands similar to those in Example 1.8-6 to construct a stacked
bar graph showing the breakdown of the total volume of sales into online and
catalog.

```{r}
barplot(m, names.arg = dat11$Month, col = c('darkblue', 'red'), ylim = c(0,115),
        legend.text = c('Online','Catalog'), beside = F, las = 2,ylab='Volume of Sales [units]',xlab='Month')
title(' Bar Graph Showing the Breakdown of the Total Volume of Sales into 
Online and Catalog')
```
> (c) Comment on the relative advantages of each of the two types of plots.

The stacked bar plot provides a good visual of the total volume of sales.
The side by side bar plot makes it easy to compare catalog and online sales
with each other month to month or for any month. 

## Problem 14

> A study is initiated to compare the effect of two levels of fertilization 
and two levels of watering on the yield per bushel for a variety of corn. One
hundred bushels are to be grown under each of the four combinations of 
fertilization and watering.

> (a) How many populations are involved in this study?

There are four populations representing the 4 unique treatments in this study.

> (b) The population(s) involved is (are) hypothetical: True or false?

False

> (c) The variable of interest is qualitative: True or false?

False

> (d) List the factors and their levels involved in this study.

factors: fertilization, watering
fertilization levels: A, B
watering levels: 1, 2

> (e) Suppose the experiment will be carried out on two farms, one using 
traditional pest control practices and one that uses organic practices. To
avoid confounding the factors in this study with the potentially influential
factor of pest control practices, all fertilization and watering levels must 
be applied to both farms. True or false?

True

## Problem 16

> Pygmalion was a mythical king of Cyprus who
sculpted a figure of the ideal woman and then fell in love
with his own creation. The Pygmalion effect in psychology refers
to a situation where high expectations of a
supervisor translates into improved performance by subordinates. 
A study was conducted in an army training
camp using a company of male recruits and one of female
recruits. Each company had two platoons. One platoon in
each company was randomly selected to be the Pygmalion
platoon. At the conclusion of basic training, soldiers
took a battery of tests. The following table gives the
population mean scores for female (F) and male (M) soldiers. 
PP denotes the Pygmalion platoon and CP denotes
the control platoon.

```{r}
matrix1 <- cbind(c('μ 11 = 8','μ 21 = 10','μ .1 = 9','β 1 = -1.75'),c('μ 12 = 13','μ 22 = 12','μ .2 = 12.5','β 2 = 1.75'),c('μ 1. = 10.5','μ 2. = 11','μ = 10.75',' '),c('α 1 = -0.25','α 2 = 0.25',' ',' '))
rownames(matrix1) <- c('F','M','column averages','column effects')
colnames(matrix1) <- c('CP','PP','row averages','row effects')
matrix1
```

> (a) Is this an additive design? Justify your answer.

This is not an additive design because an interaction does exist. See part (c).
In an additive design no interaction exists. 

> (b) Compute the main gender effects and the main Pygmalion effect.

> The main gender effects are $\alpha_1$ = -0.25 and $\alpha_2$ = 0.25

> The main Pygmalion effect is $\beta_2$ = 1.75

> (c) Compute the interaction effects.

> $\gamma_11 = \mu_11-(\mu+\alpha_1+\beta_1)$ = 8 - 10.75 + 0.25 + 1.75 = 0

> $\gamma_12 = \mu_12-(\mu+\alpha_1+\beta_2)$ = 13 - 10.75 + 0.25 - 1.75 = 0.75

> $\gamma_21 = \mu_21-(\mu+\alpha_2+\beta_1)$ = 10 - 10.75 - 0.25 + 1.75 = 0.75

> $\gamma_22 = \mu_22-(\mu+\alpha_2+\beta_2)$ = 12 - 10.75 - 0.25 - 1.75 = -0.75

## Problem 19

> The data file AdLocNews.txt contains the number
of inquiries regarding ads placed in a local newspa-
per. The ads are categorized according to the day of
the week and in which section of the newspaper they
appeared. Use R to:


> (a) Compute the cell means and the main and interaction
effects for the factors day and newspaper section. Is
there an overall best day to place a newspaper ad?
