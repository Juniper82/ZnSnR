> 3. A new generation of hybrid vehicles achieves high-
way gas mileage in the range of 50 to 53 MPG. The gas
mileage of three such cars, during a pre-specified 100-mile
drive, will be rounded to the nearest integer, resulting in
the sample space S = {(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) : x i = 50, 51, 52, 53},
i = 1, 2, 3.

> (a) Assume that the outcomes of the sample space S are
equally likely, and use R commands similar to those
used in Example 2.4-1 to find the probability mass
function of the experiment that records the average
mileage the three cars achieve.

```{r}
x=c(50,51,52,53)
Sx <- expand.grid(X1=x, X2=x, X3=x)
attach(Sx)
pmf.s <- table((X1+X2+X3)/3)/dim(Sx)[1]
pmf.s
```

> (b) Use the PMF obtained in part (a) to compute the
probability that the average gas mileage is at least 52
MPG.

```{r}
cat(paste0('The probability that the average gas milage is at least 52 MPG is: ',pmf.s["52"]))
```

> 3. The moisture content of batches of a chemical sub-
stance is measured on a scale from 1 to 3, while the
impurity level is recorded as either low (1) or high (2).
Let X and Y denote the moisture content and the impu-
rity level, respectively, of a randomly selected batch. The
probabilities for each of the six possible outcomes of the
experiment that records X and Y for a randomly selected
batch are given in the following table.

> Let A and B be the events that X = 1 and Y = 1,
respectively.
(a) Find the probability of A.
(b) Find the conditional probability of B given A.
(c) Find the probability mass function of the random
variable X.
