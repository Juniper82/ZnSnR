> 3. A new generation of hybrid vehicles achieves high-
way gas mileage in the range of 50 to 53 MPG. The gas
mileage of three such cars, during a pre-specified 100-mile
drive, will be rounded to the nearest integer, resulting in
the sample space S = {(x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) : x i = 50, 51, 52, 53},
i = 1, 2, 3.

> (a) Assume that the outcomes of the sample space S are
equally likely, and use R commands similar to those
used in Example 2.4-1 to find the probability mass
function of the experiment that records the average
mileage the three cars achieve.

```{r}
x=c(50,51,52,53)
Sx <- expand.grid(X1=x, X2=x, X3=x)
attach(Sx)
pmf.s <- table((X1+X2+X3)/3)/dim(Sx)[1]
pmf.s
```

> (b) Use the PMF obtained in part (a) to compute the
probability that the average gas mileage is at least 52
MPG.

```{r}
cat(paste0('The probability that the average gas milage is at least 52 MPG is: ',pmf.s["52"]))
```

> 3. The moisture content of batches of a chemical sub-
stance is measured on a scale from 1 to 3, while the
impurity level is recorded as either low (1) or high (2).
Let X and Y denote the moisture content and the impu-
rity level, respectively, of a randomly selected batch. The
probabilities for each of the six possible outcomes of the
experiment that records X and Y for a randomly selected
batch are given in the following table.

> Let A and B be the events that X = 1 and Y = 1,
respectively.
(a) Find the probability of A.
(b) Find the conditional probability of B given A.
(c) Find the probability mass function of the random
variable X.

> 10. A batch of 10 fuses contains three defective ones.
A sample of size two is taken at random and without
replacement.

> (a) Find the probability that the sample contains no
defective fuses.

```{r}
x = c(rep(1,3),rep(0,7)) # 1 is for defective, 0 for good fuses in a batch 
Sx = expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x)
attach(Sx)
pmf.s <- table(x1+x2)/dim(Sx)[1]
pmf.s
cat(paste0('The probability that the sample contains no defective fuses is: ',pmf.s['0']))
```

> (b) Let X be the random variable denoting the number
of defective fuses in the sample. Find the probability
mass function of X.

```{r}
X = pmf.s
X
```

> (c) Given that X = 1, what is the probability that the
defective fuse was the first one selected?

```{r} 
pmf.Xc = table(x1==1,x2==0)/(dim(Sx)[1])
pmf.Xc
cat('Given that X = 1, the probability that the defective fuse was the first one selected is 21%')
```

> 1. In a batch of 10 laser diodes, two have efficiency
below 0.28, six have efficiency between 0.28 and 0.35,
and two have efficiency above 0.35. Two diodes are
selected at random and without replacement. Are the
events E 1 = {the first diode selected has efficiency
below 0.28} and E 2 = {the second diode selected
has efficiency above 0.35} independent? Justify your
answer.

```{r}
x = c(rep('l',2),rep('m',6),rep('h',2))
Sx = expand.grid(x1=x,x2=x)
attach(Sx)
pmf.x = table(x1=='l',x2=='h')/dim(Sx)[1]
pmf.x
```

> The events E1 and E2 are independent because E1 can happen or not happen  for the first diode 
selected and the second diode can be any of the three levels. There are enough of each level diode 
in any given batch to make them independent for a sample of size 2.
